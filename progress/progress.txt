Please write about all the progress in the project.

Backend:
1. Server side handling for books , students, and issuing has been completed.
2. Mail reminder setup is complete and inplace.
3. Updated backend models to use Prisma queries instead of regular SQL queries. Old models backed up as model_v0.


Frontend:
1. Created draft pages for login, dashboard, inventory, books issued.
2. Setup API calls to fetch book and user data.
3. Created an inventory page preview with book cards (including cover images).


Note:
> Add a .env file in client directory add the following entry {VITE_SERVER_PORT=____}.
> Add an image column in the books table and insert cdn images for each book entry. (refer book_schema)
> Update backend .env file.
    Old environment variables can be removed.
    Replace with a single variable as following:
        DATABASE_URL="postgresql://johndoe:randompassword@localhost:5432/mydb?schema=public"
